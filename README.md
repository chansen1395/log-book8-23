#### By _**{Connor Hansen}** & **{Paige Tiedeman}**_

## Technologies Used

- _HTML_
- _CSS_
- _Bootstrap_
- _Javascript_
- _JQuery_
- _VSCode_

## Description

_{Following along with this weekend's homework to create a log book application using constructors and prototypes.}_
- _User enters a country, city, landmark, and rating._
- _User can see details by clicking on each "country, city"._
- _User can delete each destination with a delete button._

<!-- #### Additional Objectives
- _If the number is 100: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "(name)! We made it to ONE HUNDOOOO!"_
- _The array is reversed if the user indicates as such in a list-box._
- _The user may input their name to be displayed along with a message._


_{Numbers with 3 take priority over numbers with 3 and a 2 or 1, and numbers with 2 take priority over numbers with 2 and a 1. 100 Takes priority over all numbers. The user may enter numbers one after another and the results will change accordingly. Likewise, they can change their name or whether they wish to use the reverse feature. These changes are reflected upon submit being pressed.}_ -->
